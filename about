            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Karuna Gatton is a seasoned shamanic healer who has been practicing the art of soul-level healing for over two decades. Working from her yurt in Eugene, Oregon — and offering remote sessions to seekers around the world — Karuna’s work centers on restoring wholeness, vitality, and connection to Spirit.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Trained in core shamanism and rooted in ancient ceremonial traditions, Karuna has studied under master teachers and carries a deep reverence for the sacred lineage of the work. Her ceremonies are guided by spirit teachers and power animals, and are tailored to meet each client’s individual needs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Clients describe her presence as grounding, intuitive, and compassionate. Her approach to healing is not about fixing — but about helping others reclaim their power, reconnect with their purpose, and walk forward in alignment with their true selves.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              Whether working with those navigating trauma, illness, spiritual transition, or simply seeking deeper clarity, Karuna brings ceremony, care, and clarity to every session.

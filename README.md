These are the files for my mom's soon to be new website. She is a shaman. 

I need to get formspree up and running in order to support the contact us page. Instructions here

	1.	Go to Formspree.io.
	2.	Sign up and create a new form.
	3.	Set the form to forward submissions to karunagatton@gmail.com.
	4.	Copy your form endpoint (it looks like /f/mnqkrgld).
	5.	Replace the action value in the <form> tag with your actual Formspree endpoint.
